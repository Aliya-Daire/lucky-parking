# Lucky Parking Project

Lucky Parking is a project of Hack for LA. Hack for LA is a brigade of a Code for America that exists to help people look for street parking with the least probability of getting citations. From a civic perspective, each citizen is entitled to know the citation history of a given street parking (eg. how, when and why citations are generated) and the possibility of getting new citations when one is seeking street parking.


### Project context

This project will have three phrases.
- Phase 1: to analyze existing parking citation with data published by the city of LA.
- Phase 2: to build the function of predicting a street parking spot’s probability of getting citation related to time.
- Phase 3: to build a real-time platform to help users find nearby vacant street parking spot with least probability of getting citations.

The deliverables.
- Phase 1 will include data visualizations of citation analysis.
- Phase 2 will deliver a map identifying each street parking’s citation history and time related recommendation.
- Phase 3 will deliver end-user platform and centralized database to provide real time parking search with minimum citation probability. 

Weekly Monday meetups will be the primary methods of updates sharing, idea discussions, technical troubleshootings, technical resource exchanges. And here is the preliminary work distributions. 
- One branch of team member -- focus on data cleaning and analysis. Search for tools and explore approaches to effectively deliver the study. 
- One branch of team member -- figure out the method of searching available nearby street parking 
- One branch of team member -- use machine learning to generate citation prediction and recommendation. 
- One branch of team member -- figure out API, method of incentivization, methods of real-time meter occupancy detect. 
- Future UX team -- build app platform

### Review available datasets

The Data folder in our Drive has some useful data sets originally published by the city of LA which plays a fundamental part for this project


### Review meetup minutes and case studies

Meetup Minutes is a fundamental tool to track the idea exchanges and help team members to recall the status of this project. We can always go back to our meetup minutes to refresh the status and further develop our projects 

References & Case Studies is the preliminary study that we did for this project. It helps to specialize our position among competitors and help to identify our unique value for this project.
